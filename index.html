                   <p> This concept for a next-gen gaming chair might be better described as a luxury gaming pod. An arc of a retractable 60-inch OLED screen provides a panoramic view. Ergonomic cushions cover the seat and arms. RGB lighting pipes the chair. A table folds in and out for PC-to-console ease. And, much like the haptic feedback incorporated into Razer’s surround sound headset, the chair’s frame is equipped to vibrate throughout gameplay. It’ll be better than any ride at Universal. But, alas, it’s just a concept</p>

                   <p>Back in the realm of TVs that look like TVs, one of TCL's other CES announcements was an expansion of its much-liked (by us and others) 6-Series line to 8K models. Do you need an 8K TV? Let's just say it's nowhere near necessary. The PS5 and Xbox Series X both are 8K compatible, which is a point for gaming in 8K, but nearly all streaming services are not. Still, TCL is known for making great TVs that cost less than you'd expect, so perhaps this'll be the first model that brings 8K to the people.</p>

                   <p>Another year, another eight thousand iterations of earbuds. But JBL is about as reliable as audio gear companies come. This year at CES, it revealed a new Tour line, comprised on these truly wireless buds and a pair of over-ear cans. The buds are intriguing because they promise Adaptive Noise Cancelling, which Apple's AirPods Pro currently dominate the market on, as well as features that let you use just one bud to make calls or listen to music, which is a complicated endeavor with the AirPods Pro. All things considered, these ought to be solid earbuds for 2021.</p>

                    Out in the farthest reaches of cool TV technology, LG teased an invention that may or may not ever come to fruition: an OLED TV for the bedroom with a transparent screen. That screen, according to the Verge, is 55 inches across, and it can settle at 40 percent transparent even while you're watching something—more transparent than past attempts at this TV technology.</p>
